🧍🏼 About me:

I've been coding ever since I was fifteen, making simple HTML and CSS websites. After getting enough experience and perfecting my development skills, I landed my first freelance job in 2019, where I created a website as a front end web developer. After that, I had a steady flow of clients approaching me for creation of websites, web applications and e-commerce websites.
